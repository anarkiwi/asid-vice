GTK3-VICE NetBSD install instructions
=====================================

Some notes:

* Most packages are called the same as on Linux, but there are no -dev/-devel
  packages, the packages such as 'gtk3' will install their headers as well.

* Also very important is to use `gmake` and not BSD's `make`.

* Do the package installation as root.

first of all make sure you have pkgin installed and it is up to date:

# pkgin update

second, check out the svn:

if you dont have svn, install it first
# pkgin install subversion

# mkdir myworkdir
# cd myworkdir
# svn checkout https://svn.code.sf.net/p/vice-emu/code/trunk trunk

now ... you will need some packages:
# pkgin install pkg-config
# pkgin install gmake
# pkgin install autoconf
# pkgin install automake
# pkgin install bison
# pkgin install flex
# pkgin install xa65             # needed to build the vsid driver
# pkgin install gtk3+
# pkgin install glib2-tools
# pkgin install gtexinfo
# pkgin install dos2unix         # only used when doing `make dist`
# pkgin install pulseaudio       # for Pulse Audio sound support
# pkgin install alsa-utils       # for ALSA sound support
# pkgin install glew             # for OpenGL hardware scaling support

(libpng-dev is required but is a hard dependency of libgtk-3-dev)

The following are optional but recommended (not required for a basic build):

# pkgin install giflib           # GIF screenshot support
# pkgin install libpcap          # Ethernet support


If you have those installed, do run autogen.sh inside the vice dir:
# cd trunk/vice/
# ./autogen.sh
that should complete without error (and generate the actual configure scripts)

try configuring now:
# ./configure --enable-native-gtk3ui
it should complete without error

lets try compiling it... we'll reconfigure again later and enable the options
you are missing :)
# gmake

try running x64sc
# ./src/x64sc


Note: VICE expects ROM images at $PREFIX/share/vice, if you've not installed
      VICE before, these won't be present and x64sc will fail.
      In that case, tell x64sc where to find the ROM's:
      # ./src/x64sc -kernal data/C64/kernal \
                    -basic data/C64/basic \
                    -chargen data/C64/chargen
      Once you've succesfully run `gmake install`, the ROMs will be present at
      $PREFIX/share/vice/$EMU and the above command won't be necessary anymore.

      Another way to test VICE before installing is creating a data dir with
      the required files (the stuff below assumes x64sc):

      # mkdir ~/alldata-c64
      # cp src/data/{C64,DRIVES,common}/* ~/alldata-d64/


Finally, once one is satisfied with the compiler options etc:
# gmake install
