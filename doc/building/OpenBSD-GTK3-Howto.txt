GTK3-VICE OpenBSD install instructions
======================================

Some notes:

* Most packages are called the same as on Linux, but there are no -dev/-devel
  packages, the packages such as 'gtk3' will install their headers as well.

* Also very important is to use `gmake` and not BSD's `make`.

* Do the package installation as root.

check out the svn:

if you dont have svn, install it first
# pkg_add subversion

# mkdir myworkdir
# cd myworkdir
# svn checkout https://svn.code.sf.net/p/vice-emu/code/trunk trunk

now ... you will need some packages:
# pkg_add autoconf-2.71
# export AUTOCONF_VERSION=2.71

# pkg_add automake-1.16.3
# export AUTOMAKE_VERSION=1.16

# pkg_add gmake
# pkg_add bison
# pkg_add xa             # needed to build the vsid driver
# pkg_add pulseaudio
# pkg_add gtk+3
# pkg_add texlive_base
# pkg_add dos2unix       # only used when doing `make dist`
# pkg_add glew           # for OpenGL hardware scaling support

the file command that comes with OpenBSD is missing features we need,
so it needs to be built and installed from source

# pkg_add git
# pkg_add libtool
# git clone https://github.com/file/file.git
# cd file
# autoreconf -f -i
# ./configure --prefix=/usr
# make
# make install
# cd ..

The following are optional but recommended (not required for a basic build):

# pkg_add giflib           # GIF screenshot support
# pkg_add libpcap          # Ethernet support


If you have those installed, do run autogen.sh inside the vice dir:
# cd trunk/vice/
# ./autogen.sh
that should complete without error (and generate the actual configure scripts)

try configuring now:
# ./configure --enable-gtk3ui --without-alsa
it should complete without error

lets try compiling it... we'll reconfigure again later and enable the options
you are missing :)
# gmake

try running x64sc
# ./src/x64sc


Note: VICE expects ROM images at $PREFIX/share/vice, if you've not installed
      VICE before, these won't be present and x64sc will fail.
      In that case, tell x64sc where to find the ROM's:
      # ./src/x64sc -kernal data/C64/kernal \
                    -basic data/C64/basic \
                    -chargen data/C64/chargen
      Once you've succesfully run `gmake install`, the ROMs will be present at
      $PREFIX/share/vice/$EMU and the above command won't be necessary anymore.

      Another way to test VICE before installing is creating a data dir with
      the required files (the stuff below assumes x64sc):

      # mkdir ~/alldata-c64
      # cp src/data/{C64,DRIVES,common}/* ~/alldata-d64/


Finally, once one is satisfied with the compiler options etc:
# gmake install
