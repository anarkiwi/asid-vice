This document is inteded for the following purposes:

- to list and explain the differences between the NMOS 6502 and the CMOS 65C02.
- to list and explain the differences between the 65SC02, the R65C02 and the
  WDC65C02.
- to keep track and document which parts have been emulated and tested in the
  65C02core.c file.


The 65(S)C02 is in many ways like the 6502, but it has additional instructions,
has additional addressing modes and fixes most (if not all) of the 'quirks' of
the 6502. All of the (legal/documented) 6502 opcodes are also available in the
65(S)C02, and some of the previously illegal/undocumented opcodes are now new
opcodes. Any 'unused' opcodes have been replaced with NOP's of different
lengths and cycles.

Below is a list of opcodes that remained unchanged (no additional cycles or
changes in behaviour) from the 6502:

The normal NOP is 1 byte and uses 2 cycles, with the 65(S)C02 a new kind of NOP
has been introduced, it is 1 byte long and uses 1 cycle, below are the opcodes
that are defined as this single NOP:

The other unused opcodes are defined as >1 byte and >1 cycle NOPs, they are
listed below with their 'suspected' addressing modes:

Note that the 3 bytes/8 cycles NOP can't really be explained with a normal
addressing mode.


The 65C02 has some extra instructions for stack manipulating with a register
other than the accumulator, these instructions are listed below:

opcode   mnemonic   bytes   cycles   comments
------   --------   -----   ------   --------
5A       PHY          1       3      push the Y register onto the stack
7A       PLY          1       4      pull the Y register from the stack
DA       PHX          1       3      push the X register onto the stack
FA       PLX          1       4      pull the X register from the stack


The INC and DEC instructions have been extended to be used on the accumulator,
in the same way that INX/INY and DEX/DEY work, the opcodes are listed below:

opcode   mnemonic   bytes   cycles   comments
------   --------   -----   ------   --------
1A       INC A        1       2      increment accumulator
3A       DEC A        1       2      decrement accumulator


A new instruction to store the value '0' (much like has been introduced, it
works in much the same way as STA/STX/STY, the opcodes are listed below:

opcode   mnemonic   bytes   cycles
------   --------   -----   ------
64       STZ $nn      2       3
74       STZ $nn,X    2       4
9C       STZ $nnnn    3       4
9E       STZ $nnnn,X  3       5


In binary mode (when the D flag is 0) ADC and SBC behave exactly the same as
on the 6502. In decimal mode (when the D flag is 1), the N, V, and Z flag
results are valid (in addition to the accumulator and C flag result) on the
65C02, on the 6502, only the accumulator and C flag results were valid.
The Z flag is set when the accumulator is zero, and cleared when the
accumulator is any other value (including when the accumulator is not a valid
BCD number). The N flag indicates whether bit 7 of the result is set or clear.

The opcodes of the 'fixed' instructions are below:

opcode   mnemonic      bytes   cycles   comments
------   --------      -----   ------   --------
61       ADC ($nn,X)     2     6(/7)    +1 decimal mode
65       ADC $nn         2     3(/4)    +1 decimal mode
69       ADC #$nn        2     2(/3)    +1 decimal mode
6D       ADC $nnnn       3     4(/5)    +1 decimal mode
71       ADC ($nn),Y     2     5(/6/7)  +1 decimal mode, +1 page crossing
72       ADC ($nn)       2     5(/6)    +1 decimal mode
75       ADC $nn,X       2     4(/5)    +1 decimal mode
79       ADC $nnnn,Y     3     4(/5/6)  +1 decimal mode, +1 page crossing
7D       ADC $nnnn,X     3     4(/5/6)  +1 decimal mode, +1 page crossing
E1       SBC ($nn,X)     2     6(/7)    +1 decimal mode
E5       SBC $nn         2     3(/4)    +1 decimal mode
E9       SBC #$nn        2     2(/3)    +1 decimal mode
ED       SBC $nnnn       3     4(/5)    +1 decimal mode
F1       SBC ($nn),Y     2     5(/6/7)  +1 decimal mode, +1 page crossing
F2       SBC ($nn)       2     5(/6)    +1 decimal mode
F5       SBC $nn,X       2     4(/5)    +1 decimal mode
F9       SBC $nnnn,Y     3     4(/5/6)  +1 decimal mode, +1 page crossing
FD       SBC $nnnn,X     3     4(/5/6)  +1 decimal mode, +1 page crossing

Note that opcodes 72 and f2 have a new addressing mode which will be explained
next.


A new addressing mode has been introduced, the zeropage indexed mode, it is
like the zeropage y ((zp),Y) mode when Y is zero, and has the same cycle
count. The opcodes using the new addressing mode are listed below:

opcode   mnemonic   bytes   cycles   comments
------   --------   -----   ------   --------
12       ORA ($nn)    2       5
32       AND ($nn)    2       5
52       EOR ($nn)    2       5
72       ADC ($nn)    2       5(/6)  +1 decimal mode
92       STA ($nn)    2       5
B2       LDA ($nn)    2       5
D2       CMP ($nn)    2       5
F2       SBC ($nn)    2       5(/6)  +1 decimal mode


The BIT instruction has three additional addressing modes. The $nnnn,X and $nn,X
addressing modes affect the same flags that the abs and zp addressing modes
do. The immediate addressing mode only affects the Z flag. Below is a list:

opcode   mnemonic   bytes   cycles   comments
------   --------   -----   ------   --------
34       BIT $nn,X    2     4
3C       BIT $nnnn,X  3     4(/5)    +1 crossing page boundry
89       BIT #$nn     2     2


The JMP instruction has a new ($nnnn,X) addressing mode, the X register is
added to the absolute address, and the resulting address contains the address
to jump to, low byte first:

opcode   mnemonic      bytes   cycles
------   --------      -----   ------
7C       JMP ($nnnn,X)   3       6


On the 6502, JMP ($nnnn) had a bug when the low byte of the address was $FF,
the page was not incremented and the second byte would be taken from the same
page but at location $00, for example JMP($09FF) would get the first byte from
$09FF and the second byte from $0900. On the 65(S)C02 this bug is fixed, at the
cost of an extra cycle:

opcode   mnemonic     bytes   cycles
------   --------     -----   ------
6C       JMP ($nnnn)    3       6


The 65(S)C02 has a new branch instructions, BRA (branch always), the cycle
count is the same as for the other branch instruction except for the fact that
the condition is always true, and therefore the case of not taking the branch
doesn't exist, and so the minimum cycles for this branch is 3:

opcode   mnemonic   bytes   cycles   comments
------   --------   -----   ------   --------
80       BRA $nnnn    2     3(/4)    +1 for crossing page boundry


The 65(S)C02 has two extra instructions for manipulating bits in memory, the
TRB - (test and reset bits) and TSB (test and set bits) instructions. Each
ANDs the memory location with the accumulator and sets the Z flag according to
the result and then bits in the memory location are reset/set according to
which bits in the accumulator are set:

opcode   mnemonic   bytes   cycles
------   --------   -----   ------
04       TSB $nn      2       5
0C       TSB $nnnn    3       6
14       TRB $nn      2       5
1C       TRB $nnnn    3       6


The R65C02 and WDC65C02 have 4 additional instructions that are not present in
the 65SC02, BBR* (branch on bit reset), BBS* (branch on bit set), RMB*
(reset memory bit) and SMB* (set memory bit). The BBR* and BBS* are branch
instructions and branch on the condition of a certain bit. The RMB* and SMB*
functions reset/set a certain bit of a memory location. The following opcodes
are used:

opcode   mnemonic       bytes   cycles   comments

The WDC65C02 has 2 addtional instructions not present in the R65C02 and 65SC02,
STP (stops the cpu) and WAI (stops the cpu and waits for an interrupt to
reactivate the cpu):

DB       STP          1       3      on WDC65C02

The opcodes above are single NOPs on the R65C02 and 65SC02:

On the 6502 the $nnnn,X addressing mode for the INC, DEC, ASL, LSR, ROL and
ROR instructions always takes 7 cycles, on the 65(S)C02 the cycles for the ASL,
LSR, ROL and ROR instructions are 6 when no page boundry is crossed and 7 when
it is crossed. Note that DEC and INC still always take 7 cycles on the
65(S)C02.

------   --------    -----   ------   --------
1E       ASL $nnnn,X   3     6(/7)    +1 for page boundry crossing
3E       ROL $nnnn,X   3     6(/7)    +1 for boundry crossing
5E       LSR $nnnn,X   3     6(/7)    +1 for boundry crossing
7E       ROR $nnnn,X   3     6(/7)    +1 for boundry crossing


On the 6502 after an interrupt (BRK, IRQ or NMI) or a reset the decimal flag
was unchanged, the 65(S)C02 clears the decimal flag after an interrupt or
reset, the amount of cycles is the same as on the 6502.


On the 6502 there is a group of instructions (the RMW group) that does 1 read
and 2 writes at the effective address, on the 65(S)C02 this has been changed
to 2 reads and 1 write.


On the 6502 when using the absolute indexed addressing mode a read from an
invalid address could happen, on the 65(S)C02 instead of reading from an
invalid address the last instruction byte is read again.

The following section is for keeping track of tests of the 65C02 core, a *
after an element means it has been successfully tested. This section will be
moved to a seperate file once all tests have been successfully done.
